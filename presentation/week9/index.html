<h3>Feedback for presentation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Appreciated the humor throughout</li>
  <li>Clear example that helped the students understand what was being asked from them</li>
  <li>Please move with purpose throughout your presentation. If you need to move have a reason for moving. Unnessary movement makes you look unsure or nervous.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chicken Site</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Have complimenting colors throughout your site, try to limit the feeling of random colour choice. Stick with your pinks as those seem to be working. </li>
  <li>Try to centre the content to provide your site with balance. </li>
  <li>Green and yellow font is hard to read on a backlit screen. Please try darker colours or using white font. </li>
  <li>Extend the background colour of your nav bar across the top of the website to clean up the look of your site. </li>
  <li>Try out a couple of different fonts. I suggest Raleway, I personally like the look of it. </li>
</ul>

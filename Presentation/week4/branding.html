    <h2>Laura Secord</h2>
    <p>n 1913, Frank P. O’Connor opened a small candy store in Toronto
      where he sold hand-made chocolates. He named his store after Laura Secord,
      the Canadian heroine who was a symbol of courage, devotion, and loyalty.
    </p>

    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <p>Canadian Brand</p>
    <p>96 shops in Ontario</p>
    <p>
      Roots are in Toronto.
    </p>
    <p>
       The use of a hero is great for the Branding and logo.
    </p>

    <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
    <p>expenises</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The products are costly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is a privatly owned campany without the growth possibilities of shareholders.
    </p>

    <h1>Logo Inspiration</h1>
    <h2>How the logo shows what the company is about</h2>
    <p>
Parrot Chocolatiers uses a simple design of a parrot. This design allows the company to place this colourful eyecatching logo on packaging.
It also is a simple idea, so it can be inculded in the design of the choloates. The Parrot can be carved into the cholates.
    </p>

    <h2>Why the logo is effective for the brand</h2>
    <p>
The colours will be eyecatching for the dismal streets of toronto. The design can be used in 2d or in 3d for a street sign.
The parrot will work with the inside of the store if they choose to decorate it with the brand colours.
    </p>

    <h2>How the branding/logo makes us stand out</h2>
    <p>
COLOUR!

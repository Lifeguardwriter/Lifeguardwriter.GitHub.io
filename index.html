    <h2>Once upon a time</h2>
    <p>
        That is how most stories start. However, on the web, a page does not start with the intro to a cute story about a girl in a dress. Rather, it starts with a text editor program. Not as glamorous I will say but much cooler than putting your life at the disposal of a fairy godmother.
    </p>

    <h2>Atom in web page terms</h2>
    <p>
        Atom is a code editor. It allows you to write code on your computer and make things pretty and organized. It will also allow you to type lines and lines of code. However, this is all useless without a repository to put it in.
    </p>

    <h2>GitHub the asshole, well not really</h2>
    <p>
        We needed a place to host our repo on the interwebs. A good place to do this is "https://github.com". This place is where millions of web people put things on the internet. We created a repository for the project I am currently typing on GitHub. There it becomes the host for our content. In our case a web page.
    </p>

    <h2>Make the connection!</h2>
    <p>
        We now have lovely files located on our computer and this repo waiting for this information. Time to make the connection. Download GitHub to your desktop. This will allow you to have your repo online interact with our code editor. Once that is down you can interact with your repo through opening it in your text editor. Create a file and away you go.
    </p>


    <h2>You Don't have to have Commitment in your Relationships but you do in GitHub</h2>
    <p>
        Once you have written a ton of code you need to say yes to putting it on the internet. Go to your GitHub and commit to putting it up. It will show you all the changes you have made. Say "yes" and it will be sent to the interwebs (Well, more like press "sync").

    <p>
      You have successfully put stuff on the web. Now good luck making it look pretty.
    </p>

    <h2>Do not do this</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Do not edit from your repo Do not delete any files from your dev folder, if you put something there by accident just leave it. Git is tracking all the changes. Git knows you are trying to delete it, and it will know if you are trying to get rid of it. It will bring it back when you sync it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Only sync when you need to; view locally otherwise. There is a lag, so don't sync it that often
      </li>
    </ul>
<p>
  No matter what. Do not press the mysterious button in your repo on Atom.
